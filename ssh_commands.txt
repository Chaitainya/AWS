To install Apache web server in an virtual instace using SSH:::::::::::


sudo rpm -qa  --> This will go ahead and see what and all installed applications on the server.

sudo rpm -qa | grep httpd  --> If we want to know if the httpd is installed or not.

-----> Here the search is 'grep'

sudo systemctl status httpd  --> is also another way to check whether the httpd is installed or not.

sudo netstat -ntpl | grep 80  --> is also another way to check whether the httpd is installed or not.


Now, to install any software,

sudo yum -y install <software>
      eg: "sudo yum -y install httpd"

Now, we install so we need to start it.

sudo systemctl status httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd

Now we need to add files in /var/www/html/

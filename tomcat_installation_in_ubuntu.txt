How to install tomcat in ubuntu.....

As Tomcat runs the Java code, so you have set up JDK (Java Development Kit) in your distribution first proceeding to the Tomcat installation.
To install JDK, execute the given command.
--> sudo apt-get install default-jdk
--> java -version

In order to install Tomcat, you need to get the tomcat.tar file from its official website: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi (tar.gz (pgp, sha512))
--> wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.67/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.67.tar.gz
After downloading the tomcat bundle file, you need to extract it.
--> tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.67.tar.gz

Now create a /tomcat directory in the /opt/ folder and move all the files from the extracted folder to the newly created folder.
--> sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat
--> sudo mv apache-tomcat-9.0.67/* /opt/tomcat/

--> ls /opt/tomcat/

In order to manage the Tomcat server, you need to create an admin and manager user. For this open the tomcat-users.xml file and add the user details.
This file can be found in the /conf folder.
--> sudo nano /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
    	and paste the below lines,
	<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
	<user username="manager" password="anyPassword" roles="manager-gui"/>

	<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
	<user username="admin" password="anyPassword" roles="admin-gui, manager-gui"/>

Finally, you can start the server, for this navigate to the bin folder and execute the startup script.
--> cd /opt/tomcat/bin/ && ./startup.sh

--> ./shutdown.sh

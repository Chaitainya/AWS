sudo git clone https://github.com/Chaitainya/AWS.git /var/www/html/

If we try to clone the git repo in Ubuntu server, it will throw an error like the folder is not empty.

Use this command to check what exists in the folder : ls /var/www/html/

There we can find "index.html"

Now we need to remove that file the clone our repo

To remove the file use this command : sudo rm /var/www/html/index.html

Then try this again : ls /var/www/html/
Now the folder is empty.

Again, try to clone the repo:   sudo git clone https://github.com/Chaitainya/AWS.git /var/www/html/

There you are.... done.

How to create a fresh MAVEN project?

1. Open fresh eclipse and click on > File -> New -> Maven Project (click)
2. Choose --> Use default workspace location -> Next
3. Search for groupId: "org.apache.maven.archetypes" and choose (double click) ArtifactId: "maven-archetype-webapp"

4. GroupId eg: com.maven.javaproject, AritfactId: project name -> finish

* Now we will see an error at /src/main/webapp/index.jsp (Reason::: Java Servlet API and JavaServer Pages (TM) API are not present in POM dependencies
* You can find those dependencies at maven repository official wesite and search for "Java Servlet API" as "servlet" & "JavaServer Pages (TM) API" as "jsp"
* Copy the both dependencies and paste them in pom.xml file and refresh the project
* Even after all these things done, if you still able to see the error then open the index.jsp, cut everything and paste everything back and save it.

6. Now we need to set the build path to jdk
7. Right click on the project -> Run As -> Run Configuration -> 4 maven build -> type "clean install" -> Run
8. Now, refresh the project again and now you can able to see the war file in target location.
9. Use the WAR file to deploy

//// Happy deploy

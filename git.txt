How to get code from github to server?

* We need a software called git client.

sudo rpm -qa | grep git // to check wheather it is already installed or not
sudo yum -y install git // If not to install git, need to use this command


check the folder once again,
/var/www/html/
to clone the repo ->  sudo git clone <repo link>

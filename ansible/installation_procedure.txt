Ansible installation:

Ansible is present in a package called as epel-release
To install epel-release:
sudo yum -y install epel-release -- centos
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -- linux

After the epel repo installation now install ansible.
sudo yum -y install ansible -- this will pickup the ansible from the epel repo

command to list all the hosts: ansible --list-hosts all
command to list the particular group: ansible --list-hosts webservers

if there are no hosts, you'd see something like this,
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that
the implicit localhost does not match 'all'
  hosts (0):

--- zero hosts, reason: inventory file was never updated
Inventory location: /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
n1 ansible_host=172.31.12.45 ansible_user=centos ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/centos/chai.pem
ansible --list-hosts all
now, you can see,
  hosts (1):
    n1

Same way add multiple nodes

n2 ansible_host=172.39.12.44 ansible_user=centos ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/centos/chai.pem
n3 ansible_host=172.31.12.45 ansible_user=centos ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/centos/chai.pem

save the file and check ansible --list-hosts all

now, you can see,
  hosts (1):
    n1
    n2
    n3

to create ag group go to the inventory sudo vi etc/ansible/hosts

add [group name] on top of the nodes and save

now check, ansible --list-hosts all
now we can see like this,
  hosts (3):
    n1
    n2
    n3
